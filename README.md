<h1 align="center">ACCENT REMOVER</h1>

## What is this project ?

This Python script reads a text file, removes all accents from the characters, and writes the result to a new file. It utilizes the unicodedata library to normalize and filter out non-ASCII characters, ensuring that the output text is free of accents. The script is easy to use and can be customized to process any input and output file paths.
